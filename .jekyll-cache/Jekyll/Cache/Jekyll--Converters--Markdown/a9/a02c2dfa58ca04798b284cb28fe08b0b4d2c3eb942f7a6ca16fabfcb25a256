<p>So, I love music. This comes especially in the form of playing songs with chords on my piano keyboard and <em>trying</em> to sing along.</p>

<p>The problem is that I’m not the best singer. It’s pretty hard for me to match the pitch of what I’m hearing or thinking.</p>

<p>“There must be some online tool to help me with this!”, I thought. Well, there were, but being an engineer they weren’t exactly what I was looking for, so naturally I had to make my own tool.</p>
