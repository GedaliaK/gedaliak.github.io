<p>So, I love music. This comes especially in the form of playing songs with chords on my piano keyboard and <em>trying</em> to sing along.</p>

<p>The problem is that I‚Äôm not the best singer. It‚Äôs pretty hard for me to match the pitch of what I‚Äôm hearing or thinking.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere must be some online tool to help me with this!‚Äù, I thought. Well, there were, but being an engineer they weren‚Äôt exactly what I was looking for, so naturally I had to make my own tool.</p>

<p>I wanted something that could tell me, precisely, what I was singing relative to the piano. If I wanted to sing A4 and I was singing G4, I wanted to know that.</p>
