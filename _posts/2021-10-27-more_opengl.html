<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Over the summer I did another dive into OpenGL. Graphics still fascinate me, especially seeing the beautiful effects that can be purely mathematically generated.</p>

<p>I learned some more advanced features this time around, including making algorithms for generating all sorts of shapes/meshes, lighting, and instancing (a way to render many of a similar graphic primitive in parallel)!</p>
<h3>Getting Some 3D Meshes</h3>
<p>I first had to relearn the basics of OpenGL (making 2D triangles, adding colors, rendering lines and points, etc.), but eventually (or maybe a few eventuallies) I was able to generate some points with math, connect those points together correctly, add some color, and do some movement of the generated mesh.</p>

<p>Here's what some of those looked like:</p>

<h3>Adding Some Lighting</h3>
<p>Next I added some Phong Lighting, which basically light objects based off how a light source hits an object, the object's natural luminescense.

<small>Cubes moving around, acting as light sources, their color adds together on the white surface. </small>

</p>

<p>As a few final demos for lighting I: 
  <ul>
    <li>generated some hills using Perlin Noise (a type of random number system where numbers next to each other have some wave-like correllation)</li>
    <li>and added camera control, so you can use the keyboard to move around the world</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<small>Extra smooth hills (extra poor video quality!).</small>

<h3>Instancing (Many Blades of Grass)</h3>
<p>One final topic I looked at was instancing, which is the ability to efficiently draw many of the same graphics primitives, such as grass. This is done by giving the GPU some mesh/item you want to draw, and instruction for how and where you want to draw some number of that item.</p>

<p>I generated a little map and put as many blades of grass as my integrated graphics card could seem to handle, and voila, we have an FPS (sort of?).</p>
